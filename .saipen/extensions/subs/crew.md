# saicrew -- the serial full-platoon convergence circuit

**`sc` (`saipen crew`) is the whole built-in crew walked in a FIXED ORDER by
one agent until the system reaches a fixed point: another fresh pass has
nothing real left to change.** It is not a window layout, not a parallel
runtime, not a macro that calls `cc`/`eee`/`qqq` once. It is an orchestrator
over the primitives the protocol already defines, and it adds exactly one
mechanism of its own -- the durable orchestration target
(`execution_intent: converge` with `converge_target: crew`) that makes the
circuit resumable across crashes and derivable from evidence rather than from
a dumb stage counter.

The built-in crew registry is defined ONCE, in
`tools/saipen_engine/subs.py` (`CREW_ROLES` / `CREW_STAGES`), and consumed by
`saipen crew --dry-run`, `saipen crew`, the
`--gate crew` validator gate, docs parity and the tests -- never duplicated
in five files. Custom subs are standalone by default; `sc` never runs every
arbitrary `sai*` worker.

## The built-in registry (one source of truth)

| Role | Class | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Core** | the writer | the only main-tree writer; converges work, tests, HUNT, CLEAN |
| **saihunt** | sensor | finds bugs (HUNT signals -> findings in its OUTBOX) |
| **saitest** | sensor | independently reproduces hypotheses (REPRODUCED / NOT_REPRODUCED / BLOCKED) |
| **saipython** | sensor | tail fixer: clones targets into its pen, verifies, hands ready patches through OUTBOX |
| **saiui** | sensor | UI designer: audits against `saipen/UI.md`, redesigns in its pen, hands patches through OUTBOX. Applicability `visual-surface` -- skipped with a receipt in a project with no visual implementation file |
| **saitranslate** | producer | canonical specialized translation runtime (`.saipen/saitranslate/`, one role, one lifecycle, one OUTBOX) |
| **saiwiki** | producer | documentation factory (`.saipen/extensions/subs/saiwiki/`) |

## Applicability -- a stage nobody needs is not a stage

**A built-in role runs when the project has something for it to work on, and is
skipped with a receipt when it does not.** The roster used to be static:
`ensure_instance` was a bool, so a mandatory UI stage ran against a surface that
does not exist and the honest report of that fact -- "there is nothing to scan"
-- became a Core review ticket every cycle. The cost was never the empty
package. A scanner that honestly finds nothing has done its job. The cost is
that **absence of a surface and correctness of a surface reported identically**,
so a reader of the crew record could not tell "UI was audited and is fine" from
"there is no UI".

Each role declares one probe name from a closed set
(`tools/saipen_engine/applicability.py`). `always` is the default and means the
role declares no condition. `visual-surface` answers from the project's own
tracked files -- the same scan saiui's charter performs by hand -- and is the
only condition any built-in declares today.

Two rules make it safe to skip anything at all:

- **Undecidable is APPLICABLE.** No facts, an unreadable tree, or a probe name
  the registry does not know all resolve to APPLICABLE. A capability that runs
  when it need not have costs a pass; one silently skipped costs the coverage it
  existed to provide, and nothing reports the difference. The model fails toward
  doing the work.
- **A verdict always names the deciding fact.** `NOT_APPLICABLE` with no reason
  is indistinguishable from a stage nobody ran. The receipt is what the stage is
  satisfied BY, so it is written into the plan and survives a predecessor block
  -- an operator reading a blocked circuit still sees why that stage is quiet.

A NOT_APPLICABLE role costs no model run, no package, no Core review ticket, no
spawned instance, and is excluded from the collect set, the pre-ship evidence
set, the final fixed point and post-ship certification. It is not "skipped and
hoped for"; it is answered.

Sensors are the core-review platoon; producers are the handoff factories.
Core remains the sole main-tree writer -- every worker is `read-only` toward
the project, and their only door out is `kitchen/OUTBOX.md`; Core pulls
through the collect primitive.

## Two execution shapes, two different mechanisms

**The launcher is OPTIONAL and is never `saipen crew`.** The legacy manual
multi-window helper (`bootstrap/saipen_crew.bat` / `saipen_crew.sh`) opens
separate terminals, one per role, so several agents can work the same factory
in parallel -- a convenience for platforms that cannot run one agent through
the whole circuit. Nothing it does defines what `saipen crew` means.

**`sc` / `saipen crew` is the serial circuit.** One agent walks every stage
in fixed order, re-evaluating mechanical truth after each stage, until a
fresh pass has nothing real left to change or a genuine blocker/safety valve
stops it. `cc` while the crew target is active resumes the crew, not ordinary
convergence.

**A SubSaipen is an authority/state namespace, not a mandatory process or
chat-session boundary.** Serial SC executes each role IN THE CURRENT AGENT
session unless an explicit external worker runtime is already being used. The
machine action names the role, its exact STATE/BOARD/LOG/OUTBOX paths, the
write boundary and the completion condition; the current agent becomes that
role, does the work inside the role's own `.saipen/extensions/subs/<role>/`
(or `.saipen/saitranslate/`) namespace, and hands back so the planner
re-evaluates. No model SDK, no daemon, no human courier, no second window
required.

## Start the circuit

```
saipen crew --dry-run --json    # read-only: derive the full circuit, show every
                                # role's mechanical health, name the first
                                # unsatisfied stage. Zero writes.
saipen crew                     # persist execution_intent: converge +
                                # converge_target: crew, run the mechanical
                                # transitions it owns (sub sync, required
                                # instance assurance), and resume the circuit.
```

A bare subSaipen name (`saihunt`, `saitest`, `saipython`, `saiui`) is a
**role-adopt** command (PROTOCOL.md § 7): the agent spawns that sub if it
doesn't exist yet, becomes it, and starts its loop -- no second command
needed. A trailing `init`/`start` means exactly the same thing, and any one
of them works standalone, with no crew and no other window running.

## The circuit -- fixed order, fixed-point semantics

| # | Machine stage | Owner | Satisfied when | Condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SC-0 | `recover-sync` | CORE | no pending operation; installed home is proven; source identity, strict MANIFEST, and inherited contract are current | CORE_RECOVERY_CURRENT |
| SC-1 | `instances` | CORE | every APPLICABLE durable built-in exists with a current project-local role revision; a role whose applicability probe answers NOT_APPLICABLE is not spawned, adopted or registered | ROSTER_CURRENT |
| SC-2 | `saihunt` | SENSOR | terminal valid board plus complete current-source OUTBOX evidence | SENSOR_EVIDENCE_CURRENT |
| SC-3 | `saitest` | SENSOR | terminal valid board plus complete current-source OUTBOX evidence | SENSOR_EVIDENCE_CURRENT |
| SC-4 | `saipython` | SENSOR | terminal valid board plus complete current-source OUTBOX evidence | SENSOR_EVIDENCE_CURRENT |
| SC-5 | `saiui` | SENSOR | terminal valid board plus complete current-source OUTBOX evidence, OR a NOT_APPLICABLE receipt naming the deciding fact | SENSOR_EVIDENCE_CURRENT |
| SC-6 | `core-collect` | CORE | each core-review READY package durably ingested as one ordinary Core review hypothesis; the reviewed claim is written only after the linked Core ticket is terminal (INTAKE != REVIEW, REVIEWED TEXT IS NOT A REVIEW DISPOSITION) | SENSOR_INTAKE_DISPOSED |
| SC-7 | `core-converge` | CORE | canonical Core convergence verdict current against one source identity (TEST, forced HUNT, CLEAN, post-clean TEST, final HUNT recorded in order); working tree fully attributed | CORE_CONVERGENCE_CURRENT |
| SC-8 | `saitranslate` | PRODUCER | current pre-ship package was prepared and integrated, or the epoch-bound release receipt proves that integration | PRODUCER_INTEGRATION_CURRENT |
| SC-9 | `saiwiki` | PRODUCER | current pre-ship package was prepared and integrated, or the epoch-bound release receipt proves that integration | PRODUCER_INTEGRATION_CURRENT |
| SC-10 | `final-fixed-point` | CORE_AND_SENSORS | Core closure still holds and every sensor is CURRENT after producer integration | FINAL_FIXED_POINT_CURRENT |
| SC-11 | `ship` | RELEASE_EXECUTOR | one COMMITTED, REMOTE_VERIFIED release receipt binds this crew epoch and closure commit | RELEASE_VERIFIED |
| SC-12 | `post-ship` | CORE | every core-review role CURRENT against shipped HEAD (RUN_ROLE -> COLLECT_ROLE -> Core review -> disposition), and final EE/QQ remain READY/current against shipped HEAD/tree | POST_SHIP_CERTIFIED |
| SC-13 | `finalize` | CORE_FINALIZER | one final LOG/STATE mutation returns to targetless `execution_intent: normal`, `phase: DONE`; fresh `--gate crew` has zero problems | CREW_FINALIZED |

SC-13 finalization is a **local/runtime mutation, not a published one**: the terminal ship (SC-11) is the final published closure, and it cannot contain finalization evidence its own finalizer has not written yet. The finalization evidence record (`.saipen/kitchen/crew_release_evidence.json`) is local runtime evidence; a later closure stages it if one happens. The public `--gate crew` verdict is derived from **committed** STATE/LOG only, so a fresh clone of the terminal ref reproduces the local verdict without `.saipen/recovery/ops`.

A sensor stage (SC-2..SC-5) also needs proof that the role ran in **this**
crew epoch: current OUTBOX evidence from before the epoch stays valid history
but certifies nothing new. Once the role's package is in its OUTBOX, record the
run with `saipen crew record-run <ROLE>` (optionally `--package <PACKAGE-ID>`,
repeatable). The command reads the active epoch, the live source identity and
the role revision itself, binds only packages that are ready or reviewed and
carry that source triple and revision, and writes the `crew_run` receipt
through the journal. A receipt whose LOG line the journal did not write -- a
hand-made `operation.json` -- does not count.

If the source changed at any point, worker evidence produced before the
mutation is stale by definition -- the circuit returns to SC-2 rather than
trusting timestamps. Every stage re-evaluates mechanical truth from
STATE + BOARD + OUTBOX + charter + source identity; a crash resumes by
deriving the first unsatisfied stage from that same evidence.

Producer integration mutates the source, so after SC-8/SC-9 the required Core
convergence evidence is re-run before anything ships. There is exactly ONE
final ship (SC-11); the post-ship EE/QQ passes are left READY/current for the
shipped HEAD, never collected and shipped again.

## The hand-off contract -- the whole point

**A stage passes the next stage a reproduction or a verdict. Never a claim.**

This is the rule the circuit exists for, and it is not abstract. Observed, in
a user's transcript, an agent that had archived a file its own entry point
loads at runtime:

> "Всё готово. Production Ready." / "Проверил: всё работает."

The next command anyone typed was `python -c "import SAISENT"`, and it raised
`FileNotFoundError: SAISENT_GUI.pyw`. The import rung of
`phases/verify.md`'s ladder -- second from the bottom, one command, cheapest
after parse -- was never run. A claim travelled where evidence should have,
and every stage downstream inherited it.

So, concretely, at every hand-off:

- **What passes forward is a file another agent can read**: an OUTBOX entry, a
  ticket with its `verify:`, a LOG line with the command and its output. Chat
  is not a hand-off surface; a stage whose result exists only in a
  conversation has produced nothing (RFC's session-trace rule).
- **"It works" is not a verdict.** The verdicts are the ones each stage
  already defines -- REPRODUCED / NOT_REPRODUCED / BLOCKED from saitest,
  PASS / FAIL from a `verify:`, ready / draft / blocked / stale from an
  OUTBOX. Use those words, and no others.
- **A stage that cannot finish says so and stops the circuit there.** It does
  not hand a partial result forward with a note to be careful. `BLOCKED` with
  the missing fact named is a complete result; a hedged pass is not.
- **Notes travel with the work, not instead of it.** A stage that wants the
  next one to look somewhere specific writes it into the ticket or the OUTBOX
  entry it is already handing over, or into `_shared/inbox.md` for a
  cross-factory hint. A note with no artifact under it is a claim wearing a
  hint's clothes.

## Zones -- removed from canonical serial SAICREW semantics

Earlier drafts taught a "zone" contract that lived in the ticket description
(`[zone: src/auth/**]`, `[done_by: alpha]`, `[verify: PASS]`,
`[delegated_from: T-101]`) and called it "a contract, not a promise". That was
wrong on T-1003's own law: **free prose is never mechanical evidence**.
`[verify: PASS]` in a description proves nothing, `done_by`/delegation in a
description is not identity, and no code parses zone prose. Those notes are
now NON-AUTHORITATIVE legacy/manual-launcher reminders only -- they are never
a contract and never parsed. Concurrent/zones ownership belongs to the v8
design backlog (T-442+, `KNOWLEDGE/crew-v8-backlog.md`) and will get
structured semantics when v8 begins; the serial `sc` of today has exactly ONE
main-tree writer (Core) and every worker is read-only toward the project, so
a zone contract is unnecessary in the serial circuit anyway.

## The collect gate (Core never leaves the beams lying)

SC-6 runs `saipen sub collect`. Registry policy decides eligibility:
`core-review` and `automatic` packages enter; `explicit` producers stay for
their named SC-8/SC-9 integration stages. Each eligible complete, current
READY package becomes one ordinary Core TODO review ticket carrying immutable
package identity and provenance. Intake never applies a patch or accepts a
finding as fact. LOG/BOARD/STATE, OUTBOX `ready -> reviewed`, and MANIFEST
`last_collect` commit in one journaled operation; retry deduplicates by package
identity.

## The ten pitfalls -> the mechanism that already kills each (nothing new)

| Pitfall | Killed by (all pre-existing Core) |
|---|---|
| Amnesia ("what do I do?") | State on disk: STATE -> BOARD -> LOG tail -> execute `next_action` (BOOT.md, TEST-001). Never asks. |
| Two agents grab one ticket | Claim lock + **re-read after write** (CORE.md §1.4). Lost the write -> take another ticket, never overwrite. In a crew only Core writes the main board, so this can't even arise there. |
| Zombie ticket (agent crashed) | A `DOING` ticket with a stale/absent claim is adoptable: LOG the takeover, check `kitchen/`, continue (§ 1.4). No "maybe it'll come back". |
| Fake green | VERIFY is mandatory, real harness only; cap 3 dead hypotheses / 2 fix cycles -> `BLOCKED` (verify.md). A fixer with no toolchain marks `unverified`, never fakes `ready` (PROTOCOL.md § 9). |
| Infinite "what else?" | Safety valve: 3 waves / 20 tickets per `goal` run, then stop + report (§ 2.4). ADD is evolution not invention. |
| Dirty tree panic | Dirty tree is NORMAL (commits at SHIP). Attribute before acting; never revert/commit another agent's uncommitted work (§ 1.5). |
| No accounting | LOG append-only, `[agent: <id>]` self-signs each line; checkpoint after every ticket LOG->BOARD->STATE (§ 1.5). |
| Stale patch (base_head moved) | Fixer re-checks HEAD in PREPARE, re-cuts or marks `stale`; Core re-checks `base_head` before `git apply` (PROTOCOL.md § 9). |
| Valve trips mid-run, subs pile up | Valve-sync: when Core hits the valve it `saipen sub pause`s the crew; `saipen goal` (bare) resets counters and `saipen sub resume`s them. |
| Forgot to launch one window | The launcher is an OPTIONAL manual multi-window helper, never `saipen crew` semantics: the serial circuit is one agent walking the stages in order. Every required built-in role (`saihunt`/`saitest`/`saipython`/`saiui`/`saiwiki`) is mechanically ensured (spawned/adopted) by SC, and a role that is missing or invalid BLOCKS the stage with a structured reason -- the circuit never silently "works with who's alive". |

## Honest limits

- `sc` is ONE agent walking the circuit in order. It is not three agents in
  parallel -- that is what the optional launcher is for, and mixing the two
  is how two agents end up writing `.saipen/` at once, which is outside
  Core's envelope.
- No real-time cross-window sync and no auto-apply without Core's gates -- by
  design. The OUTBOX + freshness check is the sync; Core's
  VERIFY/REVIEW/SHIP is the gate. That is the safety, not a limitation to
  paper over.
- `sc` does not waive a gate. Every stage reuses the ordinary phase chain and
  the ordinary `SHIP` with its first-publish confirmation and its
  branch-before-tag ordering.
- `sc` does not decide that a stage is unnecessary. Empty input skips a
  stage; a judgement that a stage "probably isn't needed this time" is the
  hedging the hand-off contract exists to remove.
